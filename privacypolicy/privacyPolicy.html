            Like most website operators, Rumango Ltd collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
            web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
            site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Rumango Ltd’s purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how Rumango Ltd’s visitors use its website. From time to
            time, Rumango Ltd may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
            report on trends in the usage of its website. </p>

            Rumango Ltd also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://rumango.com blog posts. Rumango Ltd
            only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
            discloses personally-identifying information as described below. </p>

            Certain visitors to Rumango Ltd’s websites choose to interact with Rumango Ltd in ways that require Rumango
            Ltd to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Rumango Ltd
            gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
            https://Rumango.com to provide a username and email address.
